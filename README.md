Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning | Python, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes
• Implemented an email spam detection system using Kaggle's email spam dataset.
• Preprocessed data by performing text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF.
• Trained and evaluated machine learning models, including Random Forest and Multinomial Naïve Bayes, for spam classification.
• Achieved 97% accuracy with the Random Forest model through robust feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
• Incorporated precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate model performance.
• Built a user-friendly interface for testing email messages as spam or ham, enhancing system usability.
